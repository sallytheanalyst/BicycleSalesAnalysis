# BicycleSalesAnalysis
An analysis for bicycle sales across the 3 branches; the Pacific, Europe and North America

# Introduction
- This analysis was carried out using Excel. The data was imported to Power Query for Data Cleaning using the ETL method where blank spaces were removed or filled. Calculated columns were created to enable a granular form of data. Duplicate cells were also removed. The cleaned data was loaded to a new sheet for further Analysis.
- The cleaned data was aggregated using Pivot Tables after which the dashboard was created. Various charts were used for this analysis which includes; line graph, bar chart, column chart and donut chart. Slicers was introduced for easy filtering of the data and to get better context.

# Recommendations
- Discounts can be given when 2 or more bicycles are gotten at once to encourage multiple purchase.
- Flexible payment plans for students can be introduced, this would influence purchase from high school and college students.
- A lease plan for low-income earners can be implemented. Humans tend to see how convenient an item is after trial.
- The organization could partner with gyms, sport stores and recreation centers, this could increase the number of purchases.
